# Anime Recommendation System

I love anime, it was a big part of my childhood and some of my favorite stories, characters and worlds come from anime. However, there is a problem with the current state of the medium. 

There is so much new anime coming out each season that it completely dominates the conversation in the community and as a result a lot of older, and incredible, anime is forgotten, even if they came out just a couple of months ago.

This system aims at being a step in the right direction for the community. How? Well, usually when new comers to the medium ask for recommendations in forums or look for accommodations in YouTube videos they get directed to whatever is hot in the current season and that is a big part of the problem. 

This system uses deep learning algorithms, along side other techniques, to give people qualitative recommendations based on animes they previously enjoyed, without putting much weight into how recent the recommended shows are. This way people get good recommendations and there is also a better chance for older anime to shine.
